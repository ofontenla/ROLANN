# ROLANN

Novel regularized training method for one-layer neural networks (no hidden layers) that uses an L2-norm penalty term. This noniterative supervised method uses a closed-form expression and determines the optimum set of weights by solving a system of linear equations. It also allows incremental and distributed privacy-preserving learning, which means a perfect fit in federated learning environments.

This method was published in the following article:
